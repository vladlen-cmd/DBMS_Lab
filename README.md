# Database Management System Lab Practicals (Session 2024-25)

## Overview
This document outlines the practicals performed in the **Database Management System (DBMS) Lab** for the academic session **2024-25**. The goal of the lab was to develop proficiency in database creation, SQL programming, PL/SQL development, and connectivity techniques using real-world applications.

The following practicals were completed during the session:

## Practicals

### 1. **ER and EER Diagram to Relational Schema**
- **Objective**: To draw Entity Relationship (ER) and Enhanced ER (EER) diagrams and convert them into a relational schema.
- **Description**: Created and translated ER/EER diagrams into relational models, followed by drawing schema diagrams to reflect the database structure.
- **Key Concepts**: ER modeling, relational mapping, schema design.

### 2. **Basic SQL Commands**
- **Objective**: To perform basic database operations using SQL.
- **Description**: Executed `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries on a sample database as per defined problem statements.
- **Key Concepts**: SQL DDL and DML commands.

### 3. **SQL Functions**
- **Objective**: To use SQL built-in functions.
- **Description**: Applied aggregate (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`), numeric, string, date, and type conversion functions in queries.
- **Key Concepts**: SQL functions, data manipulation.

### 4. **SQL Operators**
- **Objective**: To implement logical operators in SQL.
- **Description**: Executed queries using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `IN` to filter data.
- **Key Concepts**: SQL logical operators and filtering.

### 5. **Joins and Subqueries**
- **Objective**: To perform advanced SQL queries.
- **Description**: Developed queries using various types of **joins** (inner, outer) and **subqueries** for relational data retrieval.
- **Key Concepts**: Relational joins, nested queries.

### 6. **Basic PL/SQL Programs**
- **Objective**: To write simple PL/SQL programs with conditions and loops.
- **Description**: Implemented basic PL/SQL syntax, including conditionals (`IF`, `CASE`) and loops (`WHILE`, `FOR`).
- **Key Concepts**: PL/SQL block structure, procedural logic.

### 7. **PL/SQL Function for Binary Conversion**
- **Objective**: To create a PL/SQL function that returns the binary equivalent of a decimal number.
- **Description**: Used PL/SQL to write a custom function to perform number base conversion.
- **Key Concepts**: User-defined functions, logic implementation.

### 8. **Fund Transfer Using PL/SQL Procedure**
- **Objective**: To simulate a banking fund transfer system.
- **Description**: Developed a PL/SQL procedure to handle transaction logic between two accounts.
- **Key Concepts**: Transactions, procedures, error handling.

### 9. **Triggers in PL/SQL**
- **Objective**: To automate actions using database triggers.
- **Description**: Implemented triggers for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations to monitor changes.
- **Key Concepts**: Event-driven execution, data integrity.

### 10. **ODBC Connectivity**
- **Objective**: To perform database operations using Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).
- **Description**: Connected a database to an application using ODBC and performed SQL operations through code.
- **Key Concepts**: Database connectivity, external data access.

### 11. **Views (Virtual Lab)**
- **Objective**: To understand and implement database views.
- **Description**: Created and queried views to simplify data access and enhance security.
- **Key Concepts**: SQL views, abstraction, access control.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the lab, students were able to:
- Create, modify, and manage databases using SQL.
- Retrieve and manipulate data using advanced queries.
- Implement procedural programming using PL/SQL.
- Design ER models and convert them into relational schemas.
- Apply concepts to build applications such as banking and reservation systems.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL / Oracle
- **Language**: SQL, PL/SQL
- **Platform**: Linux/Windows
- **Connectivity**: ODBC, GUI tools

## Conclusion
The DBMS Lab provided a strong foundation in database development and management. By applying theoretical knowledge through hands-on practice, students developed crucial skills in designing, implementing, and querying relational databases.
