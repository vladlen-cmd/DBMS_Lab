Practical 10 - ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)

Aim:
To create and perform database operations using ODBC.

Introduction:
ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a standard API that allows applications to access data from various database management systems (DBMS) using SQL. ODBC provides a universal middleware layer between applications and database drivers, making it possible to interact with different databases (like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server) in a uniform way.

ODBC Components:
1. Application: Sends SQL statements.
2. Driver Manager: Loads appropriate ODBC driver.
3. ODBC Driver: Translates SQL statements into DBMS-specific calls.
4. Database: Stores and manages data.

Steps to Perform ODBC Operation:
1. Configure an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN).
2. Establish connection to the database using ODBC.
3. Perform operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.
4. Close the connection.

Advantages of ODBC:
- Database independence (access different DBMS using same interface).
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Standardized communication.

Example Use Cases:
- Connecting MS Excel to Oracle DB to fetch reports.
- Accessing SQL Server database from a C/C++/Python application.
- Integrating databases into desktop applications like MS Access.

Common Tools Supporting ODBC:
- MS Excel / MS Access
- Python (pyodbc module)
- Java (via JDBC-ODBC bridge)
- SQL Server Management Studio

Conclusion:
ODBC provides a flexible and standardized approach to access and manipulate data from multiple database systems, making database-driven applications more versatile and portable.
